**Design notes: **

I had trouble simulating the leaf movement when they're falling down, but I got the tip to simulate a dribble movement from a previous discussed task, and that really helped! I wanted to make the wind vary in intensity, but the closest I could get was the option to add a gust of wind. I couldn't figure out how to vary the wind between a min and max value. I couldn't get the leaves to lay still when landing on the ground, however much effort and time I put into trying. I am happy with what I ended up with, considering how challenging and time consuming I found the task.
